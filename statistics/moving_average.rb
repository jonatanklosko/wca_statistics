      You may think of it as "how well the given person has been doing recently".
      This computes exponentially moving average (EMA) of competitor averages.
      EMA is a weighted average, with weights decreasing exponentially,
      meaning that more recent values contribute more to the computed average.
      Here we use Î± = 0.8, meaning that the average emphasizes last ~5 results
      (weight of results older than 5 is around 1/3 in total and decreases quickly for particular results).
      People with less than 5 averages are ignored (as there's not much data to base on).
